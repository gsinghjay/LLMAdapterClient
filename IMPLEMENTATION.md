## TDD Implementation Plan for LLM Adapter Client

### Phase 1: Set Up Project Structure and Common Components ‚úÖ

**Step 1: Initial Project Setup and Basic Tests** ‚úÖ
1. Create the solution structure with the three projects:
   - Common (Class Library) ‚úÖ
   - Publisher (Console App) ‚úÖ
   - ChatClient (Console App) ‚úÖ
2. Write tests for basic interfaces in Common:
   - Test for IAdapterInfo model ‚úÖ
   - Test for IAdapterPublisher interface ‚úÖ

**Step 2: Define Core Interfaces and Models** ‚úÖ
1. Implement the IAdapterInfo model to represent adapter metadata:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should load adapter metadata correctly
   public interface IAdapterInfo
   {
       string Name { get; }
       string FilePath { get; }
       DateTime Created { get; }
       Dictionary<string, object> Metadata { get; }
   }
   ```
2. Implement the IAdapterPublisher interface:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Publisher should notify when new adapters are available
   public interface IAdapterPublisher
   {
       event EventHandler<AdapterEventArgs> AdapterPublished;
       IReadOnlyList<IAdapterInfo> GetAvailableAdapters();
       Task<IAdapterInfo> GetLatestAdapterAsync();
   }
   ```

**Implementation Details:**
- Created solution structure with proper project references ‚úÖ
- Implemented core interfaces in `LLMAdapterClient.Common/Interfaces.cs` ‚úÖ
- Added comprehensive XML documentation to all interfaces and classes ‚úÖ
- Created test project `LLMAdapterClient.Common.Tests` with xUnit ‚úÖ
- Implemented tests for all interfaces using Moq for mocking ‚úÖ
- Set up Cursor project rules (.mdc files) for better code organization ‚úÖ

### Phase 2: Implement Manual Publisher ‚úÖ

**Step 3: Adapter Upload Tests** ‚úÖ
1. Write tests for manual adapter uploading:
   - Test for selecting adapter files from the checkpoints directory structure ‚úÖ
   - Test for reading adapter metadata from .pt and .json files ‚úÖ
   - Test for validating adapter file integrity (all required files present) ‚úÖ
   - Test for uploading complete adapter package to shared storage ‚úÖ
   - Use existing adapters from the `llm_training-main/checkpoints` folder for realistic testing ‚úÖ

**Step 4: Implement Adapter Selector** ‚úÖ
1. Created `AdapterSelector` service with functionality:
   ```csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// Service for selecting adapter directories from the checkpoints folder
   /// </summary>
   public class AdapterSelector
   {
       public IEnumerable<string> GetAvailableAdapterDirectories();
       // Implemented with proper path handling and validation
   }
   ```

**Step 5: Implement Adapter Information Extraction** ‚úÖ
1. Created `AdapterInfoExtractor` service with functionality:
   ```csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// Service for extracting metadata from adapter files
   /// </summary>
   public class AdapterInfoExtractor
   {
       public async Task<IAdapterInfo> ExtractAdapterInfoAsync(string adapterPath);
       // Implemented with async file reading and JSON deserialization
   }
   ```

**Step 6: Implement Adapter Upload System** ‚úÖ
1. Created adapter upload system:
   ```csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// Service for uploading adapter files to shared storage
   /// </summary>
   public class AdapterUploader
   {
       public async Task<string> UploadAdapterAsync(string sourcePath, string targetStorage);
       // Implemented with async file copying, validation, and error handling
       // Creates timestamped directories for versioning
       // Uses proper shared storage location (LocalApplicationData)
   }
   ```

**Step 7: Implement Publisher Service** ‚úÖ
1. Combined components into a Publisher service:
   ```csharp
   /// <summary>
   /// Service for publishing and managing adapters
   /// </summary>
   public class AdapterPublisherService : IAdapterPublisher
   {
       // Implements IAdapterPublisher interface
       // Integrates all adapter services
       // Prioritizes best_model_adapter for publishing
       // Maintains list of published adapters
       // Includes event handling for new adapters
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Implement Chat Client üîÑ

**Step 8: Adapter Integration Tests**
1. Write tests for loading/using adapters in ChatClient:
   - Test for adapter loading
   - Test for adapter announcement
   - Test for model integration
   - Test for chat UI
   - Use real adapter from `llm_training-main/checkpoints/best_model_adapter` for integration testing

**Step 9: Implement Adapter Manager**
1. Create adapter manager to handle loading adapters:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should load the correct adapter and announce new adapters
   public class AdapterManager
   {
       public event EventHandler<AdapterEventArgs> NewAdapterAnnounced;
       public Task<IAdapterInfo> LoadAdapterAsync(string adapterPath);
       public Task<IAdapterInfo> GetLatestAdapterAsync(IAdapterPublisher publisher);
   }
   ```

**Step 10: Implement Model Integration**
1. Create model service to interact with Python-generated adapters:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should correctly integrate with Python-generated adapters
   public class ModelService
   {
       public Task InitializeAsync(IAdapterInfo adapter);
       public Task<string> GenerateResponseAsync(string prompt);
   }
   ```

**Step 11: Implement Chat UI**
1. Create basic UI for chat interaction:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should display messages, handle user input, and announce adapters
   public class ChatUI
   {
       public void DisplayMessage(string role, string message);
       public void AnnounceNewAdapter(IAdapterInfo adapter);
       public Task<string> GetUserInputAsync();
   }
   ```

**Step 12: Implement Chat Session**
1. Create chat session to manage the conversation:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should maintain chat context and handle messages
   public class ChatSession
   {
       public Task StartAsync();
       public Task HandleMessageAsync(string message);
       public Task AnnounceAndLoadAdapterAsync(IAdapterInfo adapter);
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integration and System Tests

**Step 13: Integration Tests**
1. Write tests for Publisher and ChatClient integration:
   - Test for manual adapter publishing process
   - Test for adapter announcements in ChatClient
   - Use the checkpoint adapters as test data instead of mocking adapter files

**Step 14: System Configuration**
1. Implement configuration system:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should load configuration correctly
   public class AdapterClientConfig
   {
       public string AdapterSourceDirectory { get; set; }
       public string SharedStorage { get; set; }
       // Other configuration options
   }
   ```

**Step 15: End-to-End Tests**
1. Create tests that verify the entire workflow:
   - Test adapter uploading to shared storage
   - Test ChatClient loading and using the adapter
   - Test adapter announcements
   
**Step 16: Future Website Integration Preparations**
1. Design interfaces to prepare for eventual website implementation:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should have interfaces that can be implemented by a web frontend
   public interface IAdapterUploadService
   {
       Task<IAdapterInfo> UploadAdapterAsync(Stream adapterStream, string filename);
       // Implementation can be used by both console and web apps
   }
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**: For component interactions (Publisher with Uploader, etc.) ‚úÖ
3. **System Tests**: For end-to-end functionality with manual operations ‚è≥
