## TDD Implementation Plan for LLM Adapter Client

### Phase 1: Set Up Project Structure and Common Components âœ…

**Step 1: Initial Project Setup and Basic Tests** âœ…
1. Create the solution structure with the three projects:
   - Common (Class Library) âœ…
   - Publisher (Console App) âœ…
   - ChatClient (Console App) âœ…
2. Write tests for basic interfaces in Common:
   - Test for IAdapterInfo model âœ…
   - Test for IAdapterPublisher interface âœ…

**Step 2: Define Core Interfaces and Models** âœ…
1. Implement the IAdapterInfo model to represent adapter metadata:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should load adapter metadata correctly
   public interface IAdapterInfo
   {
       string Name { get; }
       string FilePath { get; }
       DateTime Created { get; }
       Dictionary<string, object> Metadata { get; }
   }
   ```
2. Implement the IAdapterPublisher interface:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Publisher should notify when new adapters are available
   public interface IAdapterPublisher
   {
       event EventHandler<AdapterEventArgs> AdapterPublished;
       IReadOnlyList<IAdapterInfo> GetAvailableAdapters();
       Task<IAdapterInfo> GetLatestAdapterAsync();
   }
   ```

**Implementation Details:**
- Created solution structure with proper project references
- Implemented core interfaces in `LLMAdapterClient.Common/Interfaces.cs`
- Added comprehensive XML documentation to all interfaces and classes
- Created test project `LLMAdapterClient.Common.Tests` with xUnit
- Implemented tests for all interfaces using Moq for mocking
- Set up Cursor project rules (.mdc files) for better code organization

### Phase 2: Implement Manual Publisher ðŸ”„

**Step 3: Adapter Upload Tests**
1. Write tests for manual adapter uploading:
   - Test for selecting adapter files from the checkpoints directory structure:
     ```
     checkpoints/
     â”œâ”€â”€ best_model_adapter/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adapter_config.json    # LoRA configuration
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adapter_model.safetensors  # Model weights
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.pt           # Training metadata
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Adapter documentation
     â”œâ”€â”€ training_history.json     # Training metrics and history
     â””â”€â”€ training_summary/         # Detailed training analysis
         â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
         â””â”€â”€ training_summary.pdf
     ```
   - Test for reading adapter metadata from .pt and .json files
   - Test for validating adapter file integrity (all required files present)
   - Test for uploading complete adapter package to shared storage
   - Use existing adapters from the `llm_training-main/checkpoints` folder for realistic testing

**Step 4: Implement Adapter Selector**
1. Create adapter selection functionality:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should allow selecting an adapter file
   public class AdapterSelector
   {
       public string SelectAdapterFile(string defaultDirectory = null);
       // Implementation to select an adapter file manually
   }
   ```

**Step 5: Implement Adapter Information Extraction**
1. Create class to extract metadata from adapter files:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should correctly extract metadata from adapter files
   public class AdapterInfoExtractor
   {
       public IAdapterInfo ExtractAdapterInfo(string filePath);
       // Implementation to read metadata from adapter files
   }
   ```

**Step 6: Implement Adapter Upload System**
1. Create adapter upload system:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should upload adapter files to shared storage
   public class AdapterUploader
   {
       public Task<string> UploadAdapterAsync(string sourcePath, string targetStorage);
   }
   ```

**Step 7: Implement Publisher Service**
1. Combine components into a Publisher service:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should publish adapters when triggered manually
   public class AdapterPublisherService : IAdapterPublisher
   {
       // Implementation combining Selector, InfoExtractor, and Uploader
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Implement Chat Client

**Step 8: Adapter Integration Tests**
1. Write tests for loading/using adapters in ChatClient:
   - Test for adapter loading
   - Test for adapter announcement
   - Test for model integration
   - Test for chat UI
   - Use real adapter from `llm_training-main/checkpoints/best_model_adapter` for integration testing

**Step 9: Implement Adapter Manager**
1. Create adapter manager to handle loading adapters:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should load the correct adapter and announce new adapters
   public class AdapterManager
   {
       public event EventHandler<AdapterEventArgs> NewAdapterAnnounced;
       public Task<IAdapterInfo> LoadAdapterAsync(string adapterPath);
       public Task<IAdapterInfo> GetLatestAdapterAsync(IAdapterPublisher publisher);
   }
   ```

**Step 10: Implement Model Integration**
1. Create model service to interact with Python-generated adapters:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should correctly integrate with Python-generated adapters
   public class ModelService
   {
       public Task InitializeAsync(IAdapterInfo adapter);
       public Task<string> GenerateResponseAsync(string prompt);
   }
   ```

**Step 11: Implement Chat UI**
1. Create basic UI for chat interaction:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should display messages, handle user input, and announce adapters
   public class ChatUI
   {
       public void DisplayMessage(string role, string message);
       public void AnnounceNewAdapter(IAdapterInfo adapter);
       public Task<string> GetUserInputAsync();
   }
   ```

**Step 12: Implement Chat Session**
1. Create chat session to manage the conversation:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should maintain chat context and handle messages
   public class ChatSession
   {
       public Task StartAsync();
       public Task HandleMessageAsync(string message);
       public Task AnnounceAndLoadAdapterAsync(IAdapterInfo adapter);
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Integration and System Tests

**Step 13: Integration Tests**
1. Write tests for Publisher and ChatClient integration:
   - Test for manual adapter publishing process
   - Test for adapter announcements in ChatClient
   - Use the checkpoint adapters as test data instead of mocking adapter files

**Step 14: System Configuration**
1. Implement configuration system:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should load configuration correctly
   public class AdapterClientConfig
   {
       public string AdapterSourceDirectory { get; set; }
       public string SharedStorage { get; set; }
       // Other configuration options
   }
   ```

**Step 15: End-to-End Tests**
1. Create tests that verify the entire workflow:
   - Test adapter uploading to shared storage
   - Test ChatClient loading and using the adapter
   - Test adapter announcements
   
**Step 16: Future Website Integration Preparations**
1. Design interfaces to prepare for eventual website implementation:
   ```csharp
   // Test: Should have interfaces that can be implemented by a web frontend
   public interface IAdapterUploadService
   {
       Task<IAdapterInfo> UploadAdapterAsync(Stream adapterStream, string filename);
       // Implementation can be used by both console and web apps
   }
   ```

## Implementation Order and Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Functionality
- Complete Steps 1-7 (Common interfaces and Manual Publisher)
- Test with existing Python-generated adapters from checkpoints folder
- Verify Publisher can upload adapter files manually

### Milestone 2: Chat Integration
- Complete Steps 8-12 (ChatClient implementation)
- Test ChatClient with real adapter files from the checkpoints folder
- Verify interactive chat functionality and adapter announcements

### Milestone 3: Complete System
- Complete Steps 13-16 (Integration and system tests)
- Test end-to-end workflow with manual operations
- Verify adapter announcements
- Prepare for future website implementation

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components (AdapterSelector, ModelService, etc.)
2. **Integration Tests**: For component interactions (Publisher with Uploader, etc.)
3. **System Tests**: For end-to-end functionality with manual operations
4. **Real Adapter Tests**: Using existing adapters from the checkpoints folder (like best_model_adapter) instead of creating mock adapters

This TDD plan follows SOLID principles, keeps the code DRY, maintains backward compatibility with the Python system, and ensures proper documentation. Each step builds incrementally on the previous ones, allowing for continuous testing and validation.
